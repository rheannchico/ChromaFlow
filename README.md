A little app that turns your workouts into art.

ChromaFlow is a fun, visual way to look at your movement.
Instead of charts or stats, every workout you log becomes a piece of generative artwork — shaped by the type of exercise, how long you moved, the intensity, and even a bit of your profile (like age and gender).

It’s movement → color → creativity.
